    <h1>MoodyB's recipe for the best Cinnamon Rolls</h1>
    <hr size="3" noshade>

    <h2>Why you will love MoodyB's cinnamon rolls!</h2>
    <div class="paraone">


        <ul>
            <li>All the deliciousness of traditional homemade cinnamon rolls, but in half the time</li>
            <li>Soft and fluffy</li>
            <li>Gooey cinnamon sugar swirl</li>
            <li>Only 1 rise time</li>
            <li>Easy enough for yeast beginners</li>
            <li>Great make-ahead, freezer-friendly recipe—making it an excellent
                addition to your menu of Easter brunch recipes!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lately, I’ve had even more success with the dough when I let the yeast dissolve in
            the warm milk/butter mixture, instead of whisking it into the dry ingredients.
            The rolls turn out even fluffier and
            softer, and I know you’ll appreciate that, too! The recipe below includes this
            small change.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Here’s the rest of the lineup of ingredients for this rich dough:</h2>
    <div class="paraone">
        <ol>

            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Flour provides the dough structure.
                All-purpose flour is best for these cinnamon rolls.
                You could also use bread flour—the rolls will be chewier.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> You need white granulated sugar in the dough, both for flavor and to feed the
                yeast.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole milk:</strong> Whole milk is ideal for the richest-tasting cinnamon rolls.
                Buttermilk works just as well without any changes to the recipe.
                Many readers have successfully substituted nondairy milks.
                In a pinch, you can use low-fat milk, but avoid using nonfat milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> This is a rich dough, meaning it has fat to help guarantee softness.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Like butter, egg promises a softer, richer dough</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div class="paraone">
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine the milk and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the
                butter has melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110°F/43°C, no higher).</li>
            Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden
                spoon OR
                use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed.
                Mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Using floured hands, knead the dough for 3-5 minutes. You should have a smooth ball of dough.</li>
            <li>If the dough is super soft or sticky, you can add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely,
                and let the dough rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready.</li>
            <li>Fill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8-inch (36×20-cm) rectangle.</li>
            <li>Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log.</li>
            <li>Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9- or 10-inch round cake pan,
                pie dish, or square baking pan.</li>
            <li>Rise: Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.
            <li>Allow the rolls to rise in a relatively warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until
                double in size.</li>
            <li>Bake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
                Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting
                too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking.
                If you want to be precise about their doneness, their internal temperature taken with an
                instant read thermometer should be around 195–200°F (91–93°C) when done.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. </li>
            <li>Make the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or
                whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy.
                Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’
                sugar and vanilla until combined.</li>
            <li>Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.</li>
            Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up
            to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
